# Deep Learning Fall Project 2023

## Project Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model for underwater image enhancement, developed as part of the coursework for CS590 in the fall of 2023.
We have included all our research in this paper(https://iitgoffice-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/siddharth_bhatt_iitg_ac_in/EZ1BuePw_hlKklCTkSRRp5ABCEfsGEIYF7kakgqQVGWHFw?e=GPpdjI).

## Installation
Instructions on how to set up the project environment:
git clone https://github.com/siddharthb18/Deep-learning-Fall-project-23.git
cd Deep-learning-Fall-project-23

Next just upload the individual jupyter notebooks on Google Colab. Run them one after the other(first nighttime illumination). The GAN Model can be downloaded after training and used for testing, validation separately.
